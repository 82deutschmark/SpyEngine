## Key Relationships
- `StoryGeneration` ↔ `SceneImages`: Many-to-many through `story_images`
- `StoryGeneration` ↔ `Character`: Many-to-many through `story_characters`
- `StoryNode` → `StoryNode`: Self-referential parent-child relationship
- `StoryNode` → `StoryChoice`: One-to-many (node has many choices)
- `StoryChoice` → `StoryNode`: Many-to-one (choice leads to next node)
- `StoryNode` → `Character`: Many-to-one (node features character)
- `UserProgress` → `StoryNode`: User's current position in story
- `UserProgress` → `StoryGeneration`: User's current story
- `UserProgress` → `Transaction`: User's transaction history
- `StoryNode` → `Achievement`: Achievement unlocked at node

- `CharacterEvolution` → `StoryGeneration`: Story context for evolution
- `Mission` → `Character`: Relationships with giver and target characters

## Usage Patterns
1. Story navigation involves traversing from `StoryNode` to `StoryChoice` to next `StoryNode`
2. Currency transactions are recorded when users make choices that cost currency
3. `UserProgress` is the central table tracking all aspects of a user's state
4. Character development is tracked through `CharacterEvolution` as stories progress
5. Missions and achievements provide goals and rewards to drive user engagement
6. Plot arcs connect multiple story nodes into coherent narrative threads
7. Currency system enables monetization and resource management gameplay
8. Characters and scenes are managed separately through dedicated models
9. Story generation uses both characters and scenes to create rich narratives
