story_maker.py - Initial Story Generation Service
=====================================

!!! IMPORTANT - READ BEFORE MODIFYING !!!
This module is the core story generation engine that creates the initial story.

Key Features:
------------
- Initial story generation using OpenAI
- Choice generation
- Character integration

Dependencies:
-----------
- OpenAI API: For story generation
- Database Models:
  * Character: Character information
  * StoryGeneration: Story storage
  * PlotArc: Story progression
  * Mission: Mission management
- Utility Services:
  * validation_utils: Input validation
  * state_manager: Game state tracking
  * character_evolution_service: Character development
